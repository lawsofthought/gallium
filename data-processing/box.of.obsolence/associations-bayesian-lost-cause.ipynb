    "In a typical word association task, participants are given a word and asked to produce words that are related to it. For example, for the word \"house\", the participant might give the words \"door\", \"window\", \"garden\", etc. For a given stimulus word $w_j$, and combining responses across all participants, we can list the response words as $r_{j1}, r_{j2} \\ldots r_{jn_j}$. A simple probabilistic generative of these responses is as follows:\n",
