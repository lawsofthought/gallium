    "This notebook depends on existing data sets, and ultimately produces a new one. See below for details. The Gibbs sampler, described above, is relatively expensive and must be used with all 50 text stimuli. For this, we use an ipyparallel cluster on a 16 core machine. The samplers use seeds, which are generated by a master seed, so they can be reproduced. For convenience, the results of the samplers will be cached and the notebook can be set to skip over the sampler and read directly from the cache. When this is done, the notebook completes all cells in less than a minute. Otherwise, it will take a day to a few days (exactly how much will be confirmed). "

This file is a $J \\times V^\\prime + 1$ matrix, written as a csv file, where $J$ is the number of texts and $V^\\prime$ is the set of recalled words, across all participants, that are also in the training corpus vocabulary. The matrix rows must sum to 1.0. However, because the $V^\\prime$ words are a subset of the the $V$ words in the corpus vocabulary, their posterior probabilities do not add to 1.0. Word $V^\\prime + 1$ therefore essentially signifies any remaining word, and the probability mass assigned to it is equal to 1.0 minus the total mass assigned to the $V^\\prime$ words. We label this word the `ALTERNATIVE_WORD`."
