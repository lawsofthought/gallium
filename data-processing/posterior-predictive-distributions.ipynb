    "The simulations here require the use of the ipcluster, e.g. `ipcluster start -n 16`, and will take about 12 hours on a 16 core processor. The simuluations have been started with known random seeds, and so all the results will always be identical. If you set `use_cached_result` to `True` on the two instances below, the simulation results will be loaded from the cache and the simulations will not be re-run. Using this, you can get the print-out of the main results without taking any real time, i.e. in around 30 seconds."
